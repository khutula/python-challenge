### Objectives
Write a Python script that:
1. PyBank
    * Reads in a CSV file of raw data
    * Calculates
        a. number of months
        b. net total amount of Profit/Loss
        c. average monthly change in Profit/Loss
        d. date & amount of greatest increase in profits
        e. date & amount of greatest decrease in losses
    * Prints the calculations to the terminal and to a new text file
2. PyPoll
    * Reads in a CSV file of raw data
    * Calculates
        a. number of votes cast
        b. list of candidates who received votes
        c. percentage of votes won by each candidate
        d. number of votes won by each candidate
        e. winner of the election
    * Prints the calculations & winner to the terminal and to a new text file
